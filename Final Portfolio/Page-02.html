<h2> Week 6 </h2>
<p> We created HTML pages this week and created a home page with a list of our favorite hobbies.
We created a list of our favorite restaurants with links. </p>
<p> Then we learned how to create an ordered list of your favorite websites.</p>
<p> On the second page we created, we wrote a short story and included some of our very own artwork too.</p>

<h2>Week 7</h2>
<p> During week 7 we added on to Week 6's website. We "styled" the website and added inline styles, an external style sheet, and used a CDN reference to Bootstrap.</p>

<p> During week 8, we incorporated JavaScript into our HTML pages. We added basic form validation on the Contact Us page.
  Then, we added a fourth page, which was a simple math game. </p>

<h2> Week 9 </h2>
<p> Week 9 consisted of learning about p5.js. We were told to create a self-portrait with simple shapes and then title and sign our portrait.</p>

<h2> Week 10 </h2>
<p> Week 10 we then learned how to animate the previous self-portrait we created in week 9. We chose a few simple shapes to go back and forth along the x-axis. We also selected a couple shapes to move along the y-axis, and at least one simple shape to move using both the x and y-axis. </p>

<h2> Week 12 </h2>
<p> Week 12 consisted of focusing primarily on functions. We were told to alter our spore-like game by defining functions and calling them in your draw method or within other functions.</p>
