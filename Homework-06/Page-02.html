    <p> I love to paint in my free time. I have found that since I have been in college it is a little harder to paint for fun and there is not much free time to do so. I painted this fish of a walleye my senior year of high school. I really love how it turned out. I have a cabin at Fort Peck Lake and love to fish up there with my dad and younger brothers. We fish for walley and northern. That was my inspiration behind this work of art. </p>
